Outdoor and marine use requires equipment to be built into a rugged, waterproof enclosure. Unfortunately, sealed equipment may also get very warm, anything other than low power equipment requires complex design.

## Enclosures
All my original enclosures come from the Enclosure Company (https://www.enclosurecompany.com/) in the UK. You need solid, IP67 enclosures with internal mounting plates.
## Power Supplies (PSUs)
For mobile equipment, 12VDC is the most commonly available supply from the engine battery. Many small devices such as the Ardusimple and RPi +5VDC from USB. I use sealed PSUs like (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XSCCLCD)
The RPi 3B+ is very sensitive to power and requires up to 2.5A at 5.1VDC. There is a low voltage warning if the supply drops below 4.63VDC. Use very short (200mm) good quality USB charging leads.
The RPi 4 uses a USB Type-C power supply, I currently use the Development Board, which is powered by 12VDC directly.
## Mounting 
For mounting, I use transparent cluster/stacking kits. (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08614TZ7Q). They are predrilled for RPi and I add a template with the hole patterns for Ardusimple, or any other components. They have standoffs, 2.5mm and 3mm but its worth having boxes of these
## Jumper Cables
For interlinking, you need male-male and male-female 0.1 inch jumper cables. It might be worthwhile getting a header set and crimping tool.

# RTK
**Successful integration** often requires trying every wrong (but intuitively correct) approach before serendipitously landing on the counter-intuitive way the thing will work. In hindsight, there was normally some hint as to how to do things, somewhere in an obscure manual, written in an unintelligible way, in a chapter titled “Don’t Bother Reading”.

From the Smithsonian Magazine….
*“...Steinmetz rejected all assistance and asked only for a notebook, pencil and cot. According to Scott, Steinmetz listened to the generator and scribbled computations on the notepad for two straight days and nights. On the second night, he asked for a ladder, climbed up the generator and made a chalk mark on its side. Then he told Ford’s sceptical engineers to remove a plate at the mark and replace sixteen windings from the field coil. They did, and the generator performed to perfection. Henry Ford was thrilled until he got an invoice from General Electric in the amount of $10,000. Ford acknowledged Steinmetz’s success but balked at the figure. He asked for an itemized bill.*

Steinmetz, Scott wrote, responded personally to Ford’s request with the following:

*"Making chalk mark on generator $1. 
Knowing where to make mark $9,999."*

Ford paid the bill.

__This repo is about working solutions and recipes and their associated chalk marks, but without the itemized bill.__

Recipe 1: simplest test of RTK

Do some background reading on www.rtk2go.com and find the closest NTRIP mount point. 
This is just a test, so even if its some distance away, this should work.
Our test site is Umricam:2101



Wiring:
1. Take an Ardusimple GPS and connect it to a conventional PC via USB.
2. Download and run the latest version of U-Center software from U-Blox.
3. Go to Receiver->NTRIP Client and enter in the location of the nearest NTRIP server.
